## Exploratory Data Analysis

In the previous article, we understood the basics of machine learning and its different types, with a special emphasis on supervised learning (thereby the article’s name, supervised learning). Now we take it to the next step, by diving deep into data analysis.
 
As soon as you have your data, the first thing you need to do is get your hands dirty. Supervised machine learning involves application of models (classifiers and regressors) on data sets, and in order to choose the right model, a better understanding of the data is required.
That is what **exploratory data analysis** or EDA is all about. EDA aims at gaining insight about the features present in a data set, which includes the approximate distributions that they follow, their statistics (mean, median, quartiles, etc.) as well as the relationship between two or more features, among many other things. A basic idea about EDA can be gained from the following video&#58;

The focus of this tutorial will be on the most important data analysis techniques that are used by data scientists, using python. The first component involves finding out the statistical measures such as mean, median etc. of the various features, also known as numerical EDA. Another component that will be covered is visual EDA, which includes histograms of features and the scatterplots of one feature with respect to the other. Various other techniques such as application of [scaling, normalization](http://www.datasciencecentral.com/profiles/blogs/feature-scaling-and-normalization) and mathematical transformations upon the data, which are also commonly used. Mathematical transforms are necessary as one of the implicit assumptions often made in machine learning algorithms (eg. Naive Bayes) is that the the features follow a normal or a log-normal distribution. If the algorithm being used is making this assumption of the features following a distribution, then such a transformation can help improve the performance of that algorithm. Although these things pique the interest of any mathematics enthusiast, for this article our focus will remain on the basics of EDA.

The various packages that we will be using are numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn and scikit-learn. All these packages can be downloaded using pip. In your command line, write the command&#58;

```shell
pip install scikit-learn numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn
```

If you want to use conda, just replace the keyword *pip* with *conda*. We’ll be using the iris dataset, which consists of 4 features: *petal length*, *petal width*, *sepal length* and *sepal width*, all measured in centimetres. The target variable is the species to which a flower belongs, for which there are three possibilities: Setosa, Virginica and Versicolor. The data set is available in scikit-learn, and can hence be imported.

{% highlight python %}
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn import datasets
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
Import seaborn as sns
sns.set()
{% endhighlight %}

Seaborn can be optionally set up in order to make our plots look more attractive. The next step is to load the iris dataset.

{% highlight python %}
iris = datasets.load_iris()
{% endhighlight %}

The dataset is loaded as a bunch. In layman terms, a bunch has features similar to a dictionary. The various keys of the bunch can be explored as:

{% highlight python %}
print(iris.keys())
{% endhighlight %}

![](images/EDA/iriskeys.png){: .left-image }

DESCR contains description of the dataset. Both *data* and *target* are provided as numpy arrays. Next, we see the shape of *data*:

{% highlight python %}
print(iris.data.shape)
{% endhighlight %}

{% include image.html img="images/EDA/iriskeys.png" title="title for image" %}
